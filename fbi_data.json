Ida had left her husband in March 1958 and was hospitalized soon after for various illnesses. As a result, her estranged husband placed their children in a boarding home and moved to Chicago while Ida was in the hospital. The state of Michigan took custody of the children and Ida had been fighting to get them back since she was released. Arrangements had been made for Ida and her children to fly to Florida to visit family after the September 19, 1958, court date but she did not show. Prior to her disappearance, Ida remained in constant contact with her family via mail.

Hein visited family in Jefferson County, Colorado, in December of 1982 and abruptly left in January or February of 1983 without saying goodbye to anyone. He was carrying his clothes and belongings in a black trash bag. According to a friend, Hein showed up in Clinton, Oklahoma, and then in early March 1983, Hein hitched a ride with the friend's father to California. They stopped for the night in Indio, California. Hein left the hotel room and has not been seen or heard from since. It was reported that Hein had thrown away his driver's license and social security card and may have had no form of identification on him.</p>",
